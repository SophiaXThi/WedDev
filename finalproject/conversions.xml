        <description>Encode the text as hexadecimal bytes (UTF-8).</description>
        <details> This is an encoding method that consist of numbers 0-9 and 
        letters A-F for representing numerical values using base 16 
        which is like base 10 except that you have 16 fingers.

    <conversion id="base64">
        <label>Base64 Encoding</label>
        <description>Encode the text using Base64.</description>
        <details>An encoding method that consists of 64 safe, printable ASCII characters:
         (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and = for padding) for representing binary data using base 64.
        This is a way to translate computer data into text you can safely copy and paste 
        anywhere on the internet without corruption.

        <description>AKA Percent-encoding. Encode characters so the string can be safely used in a URL.</description>
        <details> This is an encoding method that consists of a restricted set of safe ASCII 
        characters for representing data within a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) using 
        base 256 (basically all possible bytes) while translating unsafe characters into a 
        percent-sign followed by their two-digit hexadecimal.

    <conversion id="md5">
        <label>Hashing (MD5)</label>
        <description>Compute the MD5 hash of the text.</description>
        <details> A Hashing method that takes an input of any size and uses a complex mathematical 
        algorithm to generate a unique, fixed-length "digital fingerprint." The output will always 
        be a 32-char hexadecimal string.

        <label>Hashing (SHA-1)</label>
        <description>Compute the SHA-1 hash of the text.</description>
        <details> A Hashing method that is similar to MD5 but always produces a 40-char hexadecimal
        string that is a bit longer and lsightly more complex than the 32-char MD5 hash. Because it
        is longer, it is less more collision-resistant (ie two unrelated files should not have the same
        SHA-1 hash)

        <details> Another Hashing method that is similar to MD5 and belongs to the SHA-2 family 
        of algorithms. The output for this is a 64-char hexadecimal string. Widely used and trusted 
        in various fields such as security systems to crytpocurrency networks for its high resistance
         to collision attacks.
